* Use optparse for syncers

Add built-in help and clearer option and argument handling for the
syncers using optparse.

* Invoke OfflineIMAP in the same process

Currently, mailsync invokes OfflineIMAP as a subprocess which is a
little wasteful given how heavy launching a python app can be.  I
briefly looked at the OfflineIMAP code to see if it could be easily
done but was disappointed.

It would be great if any OfflineIMAP people want to show me how I can
do this.

* Long running syncers

Currently, mswatch invokes the sync process anew every time.  Pretty
much any sync process establishes one or more network connections.
There's no need to do this every time.  Better to have a long running
sync process that mswatch can feed the folders to sync as they require
syncing.  Implementing this would require modifying or reimplementing
mswatch itself.  It would also require support in the sync process.
Perhaps OfflineIMAP could be used as a library to accomplish this.

* Ignore duplicate maildir notifications

http://mswatch.sourceforge.net/#limitations

As described on the mswatch page, every sync is redundantly issued
twice.  To address this would require modifying or reimplementing
mswatch itself.

* maildrop and gnus splitting?

Maybe have maildrop directly invoke Gnus splitting and feed incomming
messages to be split at time of delivery.  This would eliminate
redundant syncs on the INBOX where gnus would otherwise just
immediately move the message into another folder.  This approach is,
however, probably way to heavy for a maildrop pipeline.

An alternative approach would be to use a maildir (~/Incomming)
separate from the real INBOX maildir (~/Maildir) where mails would
first be delivered.  This incomming maildir could be monitored using a
checker/watcher whose only real purpose is to get gnus to check the
incomming maildir and split messages.  The split would then move the
message to the destination or fallback to the real INBOX maildir which
would in turn trigger any real watchers/checkers used by mswatch.

This approach requires no additional mailsync support.  It also keeps
maildrop job small and light, decoupling the gnus splitting work from
delivery.

An advantage of either approach is that mail would be split on the
server even when the local mswatch wasn't connected.  As it is now,
mail is only split when mswatch is running.

* Use Gamin

Use Gamin to provide compatibility across the file modification
services available.
